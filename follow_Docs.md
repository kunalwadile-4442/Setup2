Great question 👍 — you want a clear API flow for your e-commerce system, with two roles (user & admin), and a mix of REST + WebSocket.

Let’s carefully design this in phases so it’s future-proof and easy to maintain.

⸻

🛒 E-Commerce API Flow (REST + WebSocket)

👥 Roles
	•	Admin → Manage users, categories, products, and orders.
	•	User (customer) → Browse products/categories, manage cart, wishlist, and place orders.
	•	Guest (no login) → Browse categories/products only.

⸻

🔑 1. Authentication & User APIs → REST

Since login/register/etc. require stateless communication, REST is best.
Also works with mobile apps, SEO, caching, etc.

API	Method	Access	Notes
/auth/register	POST	Public	User signup
/auth/login	POST	Public	User login
/auth/logout	POST	Authenticated	Invalidate session
/auth/forgot-password	POST	Public	Send OTP/email
/auth/reset-password	POST	Public	Reset password
/auth/verify-otp	POST	Public	Verify OTP
/users/me	GET	User/Admin	Get profile
/users/me	PUT	User/Admin	Update profile
/users/change-password	PUT	User/Admin	Update password
/admin/users	GET	Admin only	List all users

✅ Keep all user-related APIs in REST → stable, not real-time.

🗂️ 2. Category APIs → Mix
	•	Public browsing (listing/detail) → REST (because guests need it).
	•	Admin CRUD → Socket.IO (because it’s admin-only, can broadcast changes to connected clients in real-time).

API	Method	Role	Tech
/categories	GET	Public	REST
/categories/:id	GET	Public	REST
category:add	socket event	Admin	WebSocket
category:update	socket event	Admin	WebSocket
category:delete	socket event	Admin	WebSocket


⸻

📦 3. Product APIs → Mix
	•	Public listing + detail → REST
	•	Admin CRUD → Socket.IO (so all clients get real-time product updates).

API	Method/Event	Role	Tech
/products	GET	Public	REST (with filters, pagination, search)
/products/:id	GET	Public	REST
product:add	socket event	Admin	WebSocket
product:update	socket event	Admin	WebSocket
product:delete	socket event	Admin	WebSocket


⸻

🛒 4. Cart APIs → REST (User only)

Cart is user-specific, doesn’t need real-time broadcast.
Example: only you see your cart.

API	Method	Access	Notes
/cart	GET	User	Get current cart
/cart	POST	User	Add item (productId, qty)
/cart/:itemId	PUT	User	Update quantity
/cart/:itemId	DELETE	User	Remove item
/cart/clear	DELETE	User	Clear cart


⸻

📦 5. Order APIs → Mix
	•	User places orders → REST (transactional, stable).
	•	Admin monitors orders → WebSocket (so they get live updates).

API/Event	Access	Tech
/orders (POST)	User	REST (place order)
/orders (GET)	User	REST (my orders)
/orders/:id (GET)	User	REST
order:created	Broadcast	WebSocket (admin gets notified new order)
/admin/orders (GET)	Admin	REST (list all)
order:updateStatus	Admin	WebSocket (update status, broadcast to user)


⸻

⭐ 6. Wishlist APIs → REST

Same as cart → user-specific, no real-time needed.

API	Method	Access
/wishlist	GET	User
/wishlist	POST	User
/wishlist/:id	DELETE	User


⸻

💳 7. Payment APIs → REST

Payments should be REST (Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal all use REST).

API	Method	Access
/payment/checkout	POST	User
/payment/verify	POST	User


⸻

📌 Summary (REST vs WebSocket)

✅ REST (Public + User)
	•	Auth (register, login, logout, forgot/reset password, OTP, profile update)
	•	Category GET (public)
	•	Product GET (public)
	•	Cart (CRUD)
	•	Wishlist (CRUD)
	•	Orders (create + list for user)
	•	Payment (checkout, verify)

✅ WebSocket (Real-time, Admin-focused)
	•	Category CRUD (admin) → broadcast changes
	•	Product CRUD (admin) → broadcast changes
	•	Orders (admin status updates → broadcast to user)
	•	Realtime notifications (new product, stock updates, new order, etc.)

⸻

⚡ Rule of Thumb:
	•	REST → Public browsing + transactional (stable, cacheable, guest-friendly).
	•	WebSocket → Admin dashboards + real-time notifications.

👉 Next Step: I can prepare a roadmap diagram (flow) showing how these APIs interact for User vs Admin journeys (like signup → browse → add to cart → order → admin notification).

Do you want me to prepare that roadmap chart so it’s crystal clear?
